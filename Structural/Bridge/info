Very Useful to read:
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge

Intention:
    Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes
     into two separate hierarchies( abstraction and implementation )
     which can be developed independently of each other.


Purpose:
    Decouple/Separate the interface/abstraction from its implementation, so that two can vary independently.

- This Pattern makes a bridge between the abstraction and its implementation to make them be allowed
    for developing independently, and the client code can access only the abstraction part without
    being concerned about the implementation part.
