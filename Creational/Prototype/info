Purpose:
We create one standard object for each class,
and if we want a new instance of a class, just call method clone from any object of this class;
clone method --> has the standard specs of any new object of this class.

--> To avoid the cost (time ) of creating objects with the standard way ( new keyword ).

When to use:
if the creating object of a class consumes much time ( has a lot of data ),
 so clone an existing object is better way.


 Here’s how it works: you create a set of objects, configured in various ways.
  When you need an object like the one you’ve configured,
  you just clone a prototype instead of constructing a new object from scratch.
